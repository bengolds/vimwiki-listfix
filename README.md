# Better List Folding for Vimwiki

## Intro
[Vimwiki](http://vimwiki.github.io/) is great, but its built-in list-folding method is a lil' broken. This plugin simply fixes replaces that method with a better-behaved one.

## Installation
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), but I think Pathogen and others work pretty similarly.

`Plug 'bengolds/vimwiki-listfix`

And you should be off to the races!
